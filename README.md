This project aims to create a social platform for people who like to attend
cultural activities. It lets people control, share, and follow cultural
activities, namely going to theater plays, musicals, exhibitions, museums,
and traveling abroad or home, in a single platform (note that other cultural activities may be added to the platform). It will be an interactive
platform that allows users to share their experiences, get recommendations
and notifications.

## [ :two_men_holding_hands: Meetings](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2018group9/wiki/Meetings)
As a group we adopt the phrase _"Bir elin nesi var, iki elin sesi var"_ which means _"Two heads are better than one"_. Since we have **10 heads**, we have to organize our workflow and information sharing. Thus, we regularly schedule meetings. You can checkout our [Habits](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2018group9/wiki/Meetings#habits), [Style](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2018group9/wiki/Meetings#style) and [Archive](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2018group9/wiki/Meetings#archive) of our meetings.
