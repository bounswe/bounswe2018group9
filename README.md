This is our project repository for the courses CMPE352 and CMPE451 in Boğaziçi University. For more information please visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2018group9/wiki) page.

## Description 
  
  This project aims to create a social platform for people who like to attend
cultural activities. It lets people control, share, and follow cultural
activities, namely going to theater plays, musicals, exhibitions, museums,
and traveling abroad or home, in a single platform (note that you are welcome
to add other cultural activities to the project). It will be an interactive
platform that allows users to share their experiences, get recommendations
and notifications.
