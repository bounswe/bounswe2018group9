# Actopus Backend Project
Actopus backend is based on NodeJS Express and MongoDB technologies.

## Quickstart

1. You should have `npm` and `node` installed.

2. Do not forget to change your directory into `backend`

```
cd backend
```

3. Serve/test the application on your local browser with **cloud version** of `Actopus Backend` with:

```

Or, if you wish to serve the application with a local copy of `Actopus Backend`, you can use:

```
